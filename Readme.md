# Lodash-Fun

### Some fun utilities, logic functions and stuff that is not included with lodash/fp. 

Designed to be used hand in hand with [Lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide)


Written in TypeScript but usage in JS is perfectly fine. Named this way because I couldn't believe it wasn't taken.

#### Including

* Composable logic functions - andWith, orWith, ifElseWith
* Object flattening/unflattening
* deepConform - a powerful async object validation function.
* curryN - Allows you to preserve types on functions you wish to curry.
